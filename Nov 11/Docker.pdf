1. What is Docker?

Docker is an open-source platform that allows developers to build, package, and run applications in isolated environments called containers.

It helps ensure that an application runs the same way in development, testing, and production, regardless of the underlying system.

Docker eliminates the “it works on my machine” problem by bundling the application and all its dependencies together.

 Example:
If your Python app needs a specific version of Python and libraries, Docker can package all that into one environment (container) so anyone can run it easily.

2. What is Containerization?

Containerization is the process of packaging an application and its dependencies (libraries, runtime, system tools, etc.) into a container.

A container is a lightweight, standalone, executable unit that includes everything the software needs to run — except the operating system kernel.

Containers share the host OS kernel but are isolated from one another.

They are faster and more efficient than traditional virtual machines (VMs).

 Analogy:
Think of containerization like shipping containers on a cargo ship — each container holds goods independently but uses the same ship (OS/kernel) to travel.

3. What is an Image?

A Docker image is a blueprint or template used to create containers.

It contains the application code, libraries, configuration files, and everything required to run the application.

Images are read-only — when a container runs from an image, it adds a read-write layer on top of it.

 Example:
An image might be based on python:3.10 — it contains Python 3.10 installed. You can then add your app files and dependencies to it to make a new image like myapp:latest.

4. What is Docker Hub?

Docker Hub is a cloud-based repository (registry) where you can store, share, and download Docker images.

It’s like GitHub for Docker images.

Developers can pull pre-built images (like databases, OSes, frameworks) or push their own images for others to use.
